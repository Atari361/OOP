A shorter sentence than "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog" which uses every letter in the alphabet, a pangram. First mentioned in Mark Dunn's book Ella Minnow Pea.
There are 32 letters, only 6 are repeated, making this the shortest coherent pangram.
On wikipedia, they have a whole page devoted to pangrams.
The only two that actually make any sense are "pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs" and "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog."
Besides these, there are many others that are used my different companies to test fonts.
